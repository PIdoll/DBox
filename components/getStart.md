### Features

+ An enterprise-class UI design language for web applications.

+ A set of high-quality React components out of the box.

+ Written in TypeScript with complete defined types.

+ A npm + webpack + babel front-end development workflow.

### Style Guide

We are building this with a living style guide to showcase how to use the various components, using React Styleguidist.

The styleguide will be publicly available at [https://everydayhero.github.io/constructicon](https://everydayhero.github.io/constructicon)

While developing, it is useful to serve the styleguide using `yarn start`, which will hot reload changes as you develop.
